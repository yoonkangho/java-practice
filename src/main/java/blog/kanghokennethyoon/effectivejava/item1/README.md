## Item1: Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

###
factory methods 
1. can have name
2. do not *have to* create instance
3. can return instance of subclass
4. can return instance of different subclass depending on parameter
5. class of instance to be returned does not have to exist at the point when factory method is written
